MinIO Server-Side Encryption (SSE) protects objects as part of write operations,
allowing clients to take advantage of server processing power to secure objects
at the storage layer (encryption-at-rest). SSE also provides key functionality
to regulatory and compliance requirements around secure locking and erasure.

MinIO SSE uses |KES-git| and an
external root Key Management Service (KMS) for performing secured cryptographic
operations at scale. The root KMS provides stateful and secured storage of 
External Keys (EK) while |KES| is stateless and derives additional cryptographic
keys from the root-managed |EK|. 

This procedure does the following:

- Configure |KES| to use  
  `Google Cloud Platform Secret Manager
  <https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/>`__ as the root |KMS|.

- Configure MinIO to use the |KES| instance for supporting |SSE|.
  
- Configure automatic bucket-default 
  :ref:`SSE-KMS <minio-encryption-sse-kms>` and 
  :ref:`SSE-S3 <minio-encryption-sse-s3>`.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. _minio-sse-gcp-prereq-gcp:

GCP Secret Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This procedure assumes familiarity with 
`GCP Secret Manager <https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager>`__. 
The `Secret Manager Quickstart
<https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/quickstart>`__
provides a sufficient foundation for the purposes of this procedure.

MinIO specifically requires the following GCP settings or
configurations:

- `Enable Secret Manager <https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/configuring-secret-manager>`__
  in the project.

- Create a new GCP Service Account for supporting |KES|. Ensure the user has
  a role with *at minimum* the following permissions:

  .. code-block:: text
     :class: copyable

     secretmanager.secrets.create
     secretmanager.secrets.delete
     secretmanager.secrets.get

  The ``Secret manager Admin`` role meets the minimum required permissions.

  GCP should return a set of credentials associated to the new service account,
  including private keys. Copy these credentials to a safe and secure location
  for use with this procedure.

Enable MinIO Server-Side Encryption with GCP Secret Manager Root KMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following steps deploy |KES-git| configured to use an existing AWS KMS and
Secrets Manager deployment as the root KMS for supporting |SSE|. These steps
assume the AWS components meet the :ref:`prerequisites
<minio-sse-gcp-prereq-gcp>`.

Prior to starting these steps, create the following folders:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   mkdir -P ~/kes/certs ~/kes/config

1) Download the MinIO Key Encryption Service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/common-minio-kes.rst
   :start-after: start-kes-download-desc
   :end-before: end-kes-download-desc

2) Generate the TLS Private and Public Key for KES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/common-minio-kes.rst
   :start-after: start-kes-generate-kes-certs-desc
   :end-before: end-kes-generate-kes-certs-desc

3) Generate the TLS Private and Public Key for MinIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/common-minio-kes.rst
   :start-after: start-kes-generate-minio-certs-desc
   :end-before: end-kes-generate-minio-certs-desc

4) Create the KES Configuration File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|KES| uses a YAML-formatted configuration file. The following example YAML
specifies the minimum required fields for enabling |SSE| using AWS Secrets
Manager:

.. code-block:: shell
   :class: copyable

   address: 0.0.0.0:7373

   # Disable the root identity, as we do not need that level of access for
   # supporting SSE operations.
   root: disabled

   # Specify the TLS keys generated in the previous step here
   # For production environments, use keys signed by a known and trusted
   # Certificate Authority (CA).
   tls:
     key:  /data/certs/server.key
     cert: /data/certs/server.cert

   # Create a policy named 'minio' that grants access to the 
   # /create, /generate, and /decrypt KES APIs for any key name
   # KES uses mTLS to grant access to this policy, where only the client 
   # whose TLS certificate hash matches one of the "identities" can
   # use this policy. Specify the hash of the MinIO server TLS certificate
   # hash here.
   policy:
     minio:
       allow:
       - /v1/key/create/*
       - /v1/key/generate/*
       - /v1/key/decrypt/*
       identities:
       - ${MINIO_IDENTITY_HASH} # Replace with the output of 'kes tool identity of minio-kes.cert'

   # Specify the connection information for the  Secrets Manager endpoint.
   # The endpoint should be resolvable from the host.
   # This example assumes that the associated GCP account has the necessary
   # access key and secret key
   keystore:
     gcp:
       secretmanager:
         project_id: "${GCPPROJECTID}" # The GCP Project to use
         credentials:
           client_email: "${GCPCLIENTEMAIL}" # The client email for your GCP Credentials
           client_id: "${GCPCLIENTID}" # The Client ID for your GCP Credentials
           private_key_id: "${GCPPRIVATEKEYID}" # the private key ID for your GCP credentials
           private_key: "${GCPPRIVATEKEY}" # The content of your GCP Private Key
       
Save the configuration file as ``~/kes/config/kes-config.yaml``. Any field with
value ``${VARIABLE}`` uses the environment variable with matching name as the
value. You can use this functionality to set credentials without writing them to
the configuration file.

- Set ``MINIO_IDENTITY_HASH`` to the output of 
  ``kes tool identity of minio-kes.cert``.

- Set ``GCPPROJECTID`` to the GCP project for the Secrets Manager instance 
  KES should use.

- Set ``GCPCLIENTEMAIL``, ``GCPCLIENTID``, ``GCPPRIVATEKEYID``, and
  ``GCPPRIVATEKEY`` to the credentials associated to the 
  :ref:`GCP Service Account <minio-sse-gcp-prereq-gcp>`
  KES should use when accessing the Secrets Manager service.

1) Start KES
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/common-minio-kes.rst
   :start-after: start-kes-run-server-desc
   :end-before: end-kes-run-server-desc

6) Generate a Cryptographic Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


.. include:: /includes/common-minio-kes.rst
   :start-after: start-kes-generate-key-desc
   :end-before: end-kes-generate-key-desc

7) Configure MinIO to connect to KES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/common-minio-kes.rst
   :start-after: start-kes-configure-minio-desc
   :end-before: end-kes-configure-minio-desc

8) Enable Automatic Server-Side Encryption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: SSE-KMS

      The following command enables SSE-KMS on all objects written to the
      specified bucket:

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         mc mb ALIAS/encryptedbucket
         mc encrypt set SSE-KMS encrypted-bucket-key ALIAS/encryptedbucket

      Replace ``ALIAS`` with the :mc:`alias <mc alias>` of the MinIO
      deployment configured in the previous step.

      Write a file to the bucket using :mc:`mc cp` or any S3-compatible
      SDK with a ``PutObject`` function. You can then run :mc:`mc stat` 
      on the file to confirm the associated encryption metadata.

   .. tab-item:: SSE-S3

      The following command enables SSE-S3 on all objects written to the
      specified bucket. MinIO uses the :envvar:`MINIO_KMS_KES_KEY_NAME` 
      key for performing |SSE|.

      .. code-block:: shell
         :class: copyable

         mc mb ALIAS/encryptedbucket
         mc encrypt set SSE-S3 ALIAS/encryptedbucket

      Replace ``ALIAS`` with the :mc:`alias <mc alias>` of the MinIO
      deployment configured in the previous step.

      Write a file to the bucket using :mc:`mc cp` or any S3-compatible
      SDK with a ``PutObject`` function. You can then run :mc:`mc stat` 
      on the file to confirm the associated encryption metadata.
